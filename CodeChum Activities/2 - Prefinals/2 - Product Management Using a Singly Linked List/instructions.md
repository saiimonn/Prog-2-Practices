## Product Management Using a Singly Linked List
## by Christine Bandalan

Write a C program that manages a collection of products using a singly linked list. The program should present a menu to the user, allowing them to **choose from the following operations**:

Add a Product. Add a new product to the end of the linked list. Each product should include:
An integer product_id
A character array product[50] (to store the product name)
A float price
Update Product Price. Update the price of an existing product by searching for its product_id.
Remove a Product. Remove a product from the list by its product_id.
Display All Products. Print the details (product_id, product name, and price) of all products currently in the list.
 
## Requirements:
Define an appropriate structure (struct) to represent a product node.
Implement all operations as functions.
Ensure proper memory management (e.g., free memory when removing a product).
Provide a simple and user-friendly interface for user input and menu selection.
