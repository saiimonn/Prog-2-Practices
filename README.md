# Linked List Practice â€“ Programming 2

This repo contains practice exercises for my prog 2 class, focusing on the different operations and implementations of **linked lists** and **structs** in C language.

Exercises include: 
- Struct arrays
- Nested structs
- Insertion of nodes
- Deletion of nodes
- Searching nodes
- Sorting of linked list
- Some leetcode questions that I've answered (linked lists)

This is a practice repo to compile all of the exercises I have done across all my devices. Each file contains sample outputs and some comments that explains the logic behind the different implementation of operations.
