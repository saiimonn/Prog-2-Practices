# Programming 02 Practice Repository

This repository includes practice problems, study area exercises, and activities from CodeChum, along with focused exercises designed to help master key data structures, particularly **Linked Lists** and **ArrayLists**.

### Exercises include: 
- Struct arrays
- Nested structs
- Singly linked list operations(insertion, deletion, sorting, etc.)
- Arraylist operations(insertion, deletion, displaying, etc.)
- Some leetcode questions that I've answered (yes i leetcode im cool like that ðŸ¤“)

This repository was created to compile all of my learnings from Programming 02, as a way to review, prepare, and hopefully redeem myself for finals XD. Itâ€™s also meant to serve as a resource I can share with my peers, hoping that it would help them in their own learning journey too.
